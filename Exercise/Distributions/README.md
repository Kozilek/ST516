# Distributions

- Write a R function that:
    - simulates n random observations from normal distribution with mean of m and SD of sd

    - name the function distribution.change()

- Simulate 10 data sets using distribution.change() function for n = 10000, m = 100
    - let the sd vary for each data set from 1 to 10 
    - run the function within a loop that changes the sd in each round
    - plot the distributions and functions mentioned below, to show the change that the distribution take after varying the sd. (Hint: The plots for each function should be merged on top of each other to show the change...)
    - use the rgb() function to programmatic ally change the color of each plot inside the loop. 


Plot the following separately: 

- **distribution**

- **cdf**

- **pdf**
